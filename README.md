> Comprehensive TypeScript definitions for the Frappe Framework’s client-side JavaScript API.

This package provides fully-typed global variables and functions commonly injected by Frappe in the browser — such as `frappe`, `cur_frm`, `__`, `msgprint`, and more — allowing you to write **modern, type-safe** custom scripts with confidence.

---

## 🚀 Why Use This Package?

The Frappe Framework offers a powerful client-side API — but it’s built around plain JavaScript, which comes with common issues:

- ❌ Typing mistakes (e.g. `frm.doc.customer_name` vs `frm.doc.customer_nam`)
- ❌ No clarity on the shape of API responses
- ❌ Fragile code during refactors
- ❌ Poor autocomplete and inline documentation

With `@anygridtech/frappe-types`, you get:

- ✅ Accurate autocompletion  
- ✅ Compile-time error checking  
- ✅ Inline documentation support  
- ✅ Improved code maintainability and developer experience

---

## 📦 What’s Included?

This package includes type definitions for commonly used global objects:

- `frappe`: Includes `frappe.call`, `frappe.db`, `frappe.ui.form`, `frappe.msgprint`, and more
- `cur_frm`: The current form object, including `cur_frm.doc`, `cur_frm.set_value`, `cur_frm.refresh_field`, etc.
- `__`: The translation function
- Utility functions like `msgprint`, `cstr`, `flt`, and more

> 🧩 The list is continuously expanding as new globals and patterns are added.

## 📥 Installation

Before installing @anygridtech/frappe-types, make sure your project is already configured for TypeScript:

Install TypeScript (if not already installed):

```bash
npm install typescript
```

It is also recommended to install jQuery types as Frappe makes use of it very often.

```bash
npm install @types/jquery
```

Initialize a tsconfig.json in your project root (if you don’t have one yet):

```bash
npx tsc --init
```

This will generate a tsconfig.json file with sensible defaults. 

> One recommended tsconfig.json file would be as below, feel free to copy it.

```json
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "rootDir": "./ts",
    "outDir": "./js",
    "module": "ES2020",
    "target": "ES2020",
    "moduleResolution": "Node10",
    "verbatimModuleSyntax": true,
    "types": ["jquery", "@anygridtech/frappe-types"],
    "sourceMap": true,
    "noUncheckedIndexedAccess": true,
    "exactOptionalPropertyTypes": true,
    "noImplicitReturns": true,
    "noImplicitOverride": true,
    "noUnusedLocals": true,
    "noUnusedParameters": true,
    "noFallthroughCasesInSwitch": true,
    "noPropertyAccessFromIndexSignature": true,
    "removeComments": true,
    "esModuleInterop": true,
    "strict": true,
    "isolatedModules": true,
    "noUncheckedSideEffectImports": true,
    "moduleDetection": "force",
  },
  "include": ["ts/**/*.ts"],
  "exclude": ["node_modules"]
}
```


(Optional) Ensure you have a central entry file (like src/index.ts or src/globals.d.ts) where you can import additional type definitions.

Install as a development dependency:

```bash
# Using npm
npm install --save-dev @anygridtech/frappe-types

# Using yarn
yarn add --dev @anygridtech/frappe-types

# Using pnpm
pnpm add -D @anygridtech/frappe-types
```

## ⚙️ Setup

After installation, you need to tell TypeScript how to find and use these global type definitions. There are two primary ways to do this:

### ✅ Option 1: Explicit Import

Simply add the following import statement to a central file in your project, such as an entry point (`index.ts`, `main.ts`) or a dedicated type definition file (`globals.d.ts`):

```ts
import '@anygridtech/frappe-types';
```

### ✅ Option 2: Modifying your project's tsconfig.json file

Add `@anygridtech/frappe-types` to the `compilerOptions.types` array in your `tsconfig.json`.

```json
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "types": [
      "@anygridtech/frappe-types" // 👈👈👈 Just add this part
    ]
  }
}
```

> ⚠️ Important: When you define the types property, TypeScript stops automatically scanning for types in node_modules/@types. You must explicitly list all global type packages your project needs (like "node", "jest", "jquery", etc.). Forgetting to do so is a common cause of "Cannot find name 'process'" or similar errors.

> ⚠️ Important: In case typescript still can't find the global `frappe` namespace and other related entities after adding the `@anygridtech/frappe-types` into the `types` array, please try closing and reopening your code editor.
