> Comprehensive TypeScript definitions for the Frappe Framework’s client-side JavaScript API.

This package provides fully-typed global variables and functions commonly injected by Frappe in the browser — such as `frappe`, `cur_frm`, `__`, `msgprint`, and more — allowing you to write **modern, type-safe** custom scripts with confidence.

---

## 🚀 Why Use This Package?

The Frappe Framework offers a powerful client-side API — but it’s built around plain JavaScript, which comes with common issues:

❌ Typing mistakes (e.g. `frm.doc.customer_name` vs `frm.doc.customer_nam`)
❌ No clarity on the shape of API responses
❌ Fragile code during refactors
❌ Poor autocomplete and inline documentation

With `@anygridtech/frappe-types`, you get:

✅ Accurate autocompletion  
✅ Compile-time error checking  
✅ Inline documentation support  
✅ Improved code maintainability and developer experience

---

## 📦 What’s Included?

This package includes type definitions for commonly used global objects:

- `frappe`: Includes `frappe.call`, `frappe.db`, `frappe.ui.form`, `frappe.msgprint`, and more
- `cur_frm`: The current form object, including `cur_frm.doc`, `cur_frm.set_value`, `cur_frm.refresh_field`, etc.
- `__`: The translation function
- Utility functions like `msgprint`, `cstr`, `flt`, and more

> 🧩 The list is continuously expanding as new globals and patterns are added.

## 📥 Installation

Install as a development dependency:

```bash
# Using npm
npm install --save-dev @anygridtech/frappe-types

# Using yarn
yarn add --dev @anygridtech/frappe-types

# Using pnpm
pnpm add -D @anygridtech/frappe-types
```

## ⚙️ Setup

After installation, you need to tell TypeScript how to find and use these global type definitions. There are two primary ways to do this:

### ✅ Option 1: Explicit Import

This is the modern, recommended approach. It is explicit, safe, and doesn't require complex `tsconfig.json` modifications.

Simply add the following import statement to a central file in your project, such as an entry point (`index.ts`, `main.ts`) or a dedicated type definition file (`globals.d.ts`):

```ts
import '@anygridtech/frappe-types';
```

### ✅ Option 2: Modifying your project's tsconfig.json file

This method involves configuring TypeScript to automatically load the types by editing your `tsconfig.json`.

Add `@anygridtech/frappe-types` to the `compilerOptions.types` array in your `tsconfig.json`:

```json
// tsconfig.json
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    // ...your other options...
    "types": [
      "node", // IMPORTANT: Keep other essential types like "node"! DO NOT NEED TO DELETE ANYTHING HERE.
      "@anygridtech/frappe-types" // 👈👈👈 Just add this part
    ]
  }
}
```

> ⚠️ Important: When you define the types property, TypeScript stops automatically scanning for types in node_modules/@types. You must explicitly list all global type packages your project needs (like "node", "jest", etc.). Forgetting to do so is a common cause of "Cannot find name 'process'" or similar errors.
